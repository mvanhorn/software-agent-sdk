_WORKFLOW_DESCRIPTION = """Run a dynamic workflow written as Python orchestration code.

Use this tool for large tasks that benefit from parallel sub-agents, such as
codebase-wide audits, independent plan reviews, security sweeps, or discovery
work where intermediate results should stay outside the main conversation.

Provide a Python script that defines exactly this entry point:

```python
async def main(wf):
    ...
```

The script coordinates sub-agents through the `wf` object. It should not read or
write files, run shell commands, or perform the engineering work directly.
Sub-agents should do that work through their normal OpenHands tools and security
policy. Scripts should use only the documented `wf` methods; private `wf`
attributes are rejected. Large reducer inputs may be truncated before being sent
to the reducer sub-agent.

Available `wf` methods:
- `await wf.run_agent(prompt, subagent_type="general-purpose", description=None)`
- `await wf.map_agents(items, prompt, subagent_type="general-purpose",
  max_concurrency=None, description=None)`
- `await wf.reduce_agent(items, prompt, subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description=None)`
- `wf.flatten(values)` — flatten one level of nesting (not recursive)

`subagent_type` must be a sub-agent type registered in the parent application.
Use the same type names you registered when building your agent.

`map_agents` accepts either a callable prompt, such as
`lambda item: f"Review this finding: {item}"`, or a string template containing
`{item}`.

Example:
```python
async def main(wf):
    strategies = ["minimal fix", "test-first", "security-focused"]
    plans = await wf.map_agents(
        items=strategies,
        subagent_type="general-purpose",
        max_concurrency=3,
        prompt=lambda strategy: f"Create a plan using this strategy: {strategy}",
    )
    critiques = await wf.map_agents(
        items=plans,
        subagent_type="code-reviewer",
        prompt=lambda plan: f"Adversarially critique this plan: {plan}",
    )
    return await wf.reduce_agent(
        items={"plans": plans, "critiques": critiques},
        prompt="Synthesize the safest and simplest final plan.",
    )
```

This MVP executes generated Python in-process after best-effort validation. Treat
running a workflow as approving generated code execution.
